## Git Conventions

- **Author:** Sarmad Ahmed (sarmadahmed7@outlook.com)
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use feature branches for new work
- Branch naming: `claude/<descriptor>` for AI-assisted branches

## Guidelines for AI Assistants

### Before making changes

1. Read existing files before modifying them
2. Check the current branch with `git status`
3. Understand the scope of the request before writing code

### When adding new tooling or frameworks

- Confirm the desired tech stack with the user before scaffolding
- Prefer widely-adopted, well-maintained libraries
- Keep configurations minimal — avoid over-engineering for a personal project
- Add entries to this file documenting any new build commands, test commands, or project structure

### Code style

- No linter or formatter is configured yet. When one is added, document it here
- Follow the conventions of whatever framework/language is adopted

### Testing

- No test framework is configured yet. When one is added, document the commands here

### Common commands

_None yet. Update this section as the project evolves. Example format:_

```
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm test             # Run tests
npm run lint         # Lint code
```

## Updating This File

Keep CLAUDE.md current as the project grows. When adding significant structure (new directories, frameworks, CI/CD, environment variables), update the relevant sections above so future AI sessions have accurate context.
